                    <h3>Florance Tour</h3>
                    The center of the Renaissance city of Florence is actually quite small, easily walkable from one end to the other in less than 30 minutes and contains almost all of the main sights you'll be seeing in Florence. So staying within its boundaries makes lots of sense, particularly if your time is very limited and want to see most of the main sights in that short time plan your itinerary in advance starting from your accommodations.

                    <h3>Venice</h3>
                    Venice is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges. The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile).</p>

            <h3> About Us</h3>
            <p>For example, say you wanted to write a paragraph about dogs. The first thing you would do is write a topic sentence, such as, “When it comes to animals, dogs are a great pet.” Now you have a topic, which is not just dogs, but talking about what makes dogs a great pet. After you’ve come up with your topic sentence, you will then have to write three to five sentences that help you explain your fact. For example, in the paragraph about dogs, you may want to write about the different things people do with dogs as their pet. The following sentences would be great for a paragraph about dogs.
